      "question2":"What documents are required to rent a property?",

      "question5":"How does property financing work?",
      "answer5":"Property financing is a process that involves taking out a loan to purchase a property. The process begins with applying for financing through a financial institution.

If financing is granted, the property is delivered to the client and the financing is paid in monthly installments.",

      "answer8":"Yes, it is possible to negotiate the rent amount. The tenant should contact the property owner to negotiate the rent amount.",
      "question9":"How does lease termination work?",

      "question10":"Does the real estate agency charge a service fee?",
      "answer10":"Yes, the real estate agency charges a service fee for all property-related services. The service fee is 10% of the property value."
